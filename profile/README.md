## Welcome to wsgendb!

Here is the public Github Profile of the wsgen project.

You will find any opensource code of ours here. And the code for the organization website.

### What is wsgendb?
Automatically batch downloads PDFs for an object. There are
scripts for parsing question papers, markscheme, and examiner reports. The
output of those scripts are organizing in `cache/` in picture format. This
repository also contains a graphical interface which can be used by teachers to
maintain worksheets easily; an all-in-one place for worksheet questions, answers
and examiner report curations.
